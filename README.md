# pricing-range-accrual-products
This repository contains the code used for my MSc thesis titled Pricing Range Accrual Products.
Two different market models were used: The time-dependent Black-Scholes model, and the Heston model
The implementation was done in the R programming language.

The file functions.R contain all the main functions for:
  -calculating the price of a range accrual in the two market models analytically
  -simulating the Heston model with the "almost-exact" simulaiton
  -calibrating the Heston model
